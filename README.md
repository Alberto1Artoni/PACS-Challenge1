# Challenge 1 of the PACS COURSE

 The objective is to find the minimum of a function $f$ from $R^n$ to $R$ using various optimization techniques such as gradient descent, momentum/heavy-ball method, Nesterov, ADAM and AdaMax optimizers (a variant of ADAM based on the infinity norm).

Many of these techniques rely on the gradient of the reference function. Hence, the program allows the user to choose between symbolic or numerical derivatives.

In the first three frameworks, the code offers flexibility in selecting the step strategy, including:
- Exponential decay: $\alpha_k = \alpha^{0} e^{-\mu k}$
- inverse decay: $\alpha_k = \frac{\alpha^{0}}{1+\mu k}$
- [Armijo rule](https://katselis.web.engr.illinois.edu/ECE586/Lecture3.pdf): (we cannot apply it for the momentum/heavy-ball method)

### Quickstart
No external libraries are required. To clone the repository locally, run the following command:
```shell
git clone git@github.com:samueledelia/PACS-Challenge1.git
```
You have the option to adjust parameters related to the minimization technique and select your preferred technique in the ```parameters.pot``` file. To evaluate the performance of the code, we test it on the following reference function:

$$f(x_1,x_2) = x_1 \cdot x_2 + 4 \cdot x_1^4 + x_2^2 + 3 \cdot x_1$$

You can modify this function, but note that it is not imported with the ```parameters.pot``` file; you'll need to directly modify the ```main.cpp``` file.

To execute the code, simply run:
```shell
make
```
It handles the process for you seamlessly.

### Things to do
- If you want to give the user the choice of different strategies for the computation of Î±k, remember that the use of an if statement inside a loop is computationally inefficient.
Since we are not dealing with classes and polymorphism yet, a possibility (but then the choice cannot be made runtime) is to create a function template with an enumerator as
template parameter, and then select the choice with if constexpr. In this case, you do not loose efficiency at the price of less flexibility
- add numerical derivative
- You may want to try to define the function and the derivative using the muParser facility and read the functions from a file. You loose efficiency but gain in flexibility. It is more complex for the derivative (for vector functions you need muParserX).
- Implement more functions (norm, ...)
- Add gnuplot

### Limitations of the project
- large/medium computational time
- I currently utilize ```std::vector``` for handling vector quantities, but it would likely be more advantageous to leverage the ```Eigen``` library instead
- Utilizing a function template is not an optimal or efficient coding practice; employing classes and polymorphism would likely yield better results.
